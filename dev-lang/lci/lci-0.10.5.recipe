SUMMARY="The LOLCODE interpreter"
DESCRIPTION="lci is a LOLCODE interpreter written in C and is designed \
to be correct, portable, fast, and precisely documented. LOLCODE is an \
esoteric programming language.
- correct: Every effort has been made to test lci's conformance to the \
LOLCODE language specification. Unit tests come packaged with the lci \
source code.
- portable: lci follows the widely ported ANSI C specification allowing it \
to compile on a broad range of systems.
- fast: Much effort has gone into producing simple and efficient code \
whenever possible to the extent that the above points are not \
compromized.
- precisely documented: lci uses Doxygen to generate literate code \
documentation.
