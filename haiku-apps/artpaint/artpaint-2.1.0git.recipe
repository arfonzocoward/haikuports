SUMMARY="A painting and image-processing program"
DESCRIPTION="ArtPaint is a program for painting and image-processing that \
won a Be's Masters Award in 1998.

The main features of ArtPaint include a comprehensive set of painting-tools \
and real-time preview for many image-manipulating operations.
The key design principle has been to let the user see what they are doing \
instead of just forcing them to type in some numbers and then hoping that \
the result will not be too far from the expected."
